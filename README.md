# Comparison of Clustering Algorithms


While many clustering algorithms have been proposed, there is no clear winner on which algorithm is more suitable for understanding a given dataset. So we compare different  algorithms for different datasets. As a result, we will be able to analyze the impact of the choice of test instances employed, strengths and weakness of some popular clustering algorithms, for datasets with different structures.

Multiple problems and real-world scenarios can be understood in the terms of patterns and groups. The dataset is based on customers visiting a mall. The attributes are customer id, gender, annual income and spending score. The data set doesn’t contain any null values as it is clear from the pre-processing attempts that we made. This makes this dataset a perfect avenue to test clustering algorithms as the variation in data is high and there are no anomalies through null values.
Another dataset that we took into consideration was based on countries and their financial status. The key attributes in this particular dataset were exports, imports, GDP, inflation and life expectancy. The dataset doesn’t contain any null values making it simpler for analysis. Various clustering algorithms are used to determine which countries are in need of help financially.Algorithms belonging to the unsupervised learning family have no prediction variable associated with the data. Instead of an output, the data has just one input, which is multiple variables that describe the data. This is where grouping comes in. Clustering is the job of grouping a set of objects together so that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects in other clusters. Similarity is a metric that reflects the strength of the relationship between two data objects. It is mainly used for exploratory data mining. It is used multiple times in many fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.


RESULTS

In dataset country : After analysing and calculating the metrics we could conclude that K-Means produce the better clustering compared with others.
